  caption: Extension of Kelvin's 2-stream high voltage DC self-excited water dynamo
    to 3 streams creates a three phase AC high voltage self-excited water dynamo.
    The water droplets pass through electrostatic induction charging rings and are
    then collected in barrels. Each ring is connected to the water in a neighboring
    barrel. The spontaneous buildup of low frequency alternating charge on the streams
    is evident from their oscillating spreading and collapse.(Images courtesy of Education
